# EMATM0061: Statistical Computing and Empirical Methods (SCEM)
This repository is for EMATM0061: Statistical Computing and Empirical Methods (also known as SCEM), which is being completed as part of an MSc Data Science at the University of Bristol.  

The unit explores data science fundamentals using the R programming language, although most, if not all knowledge acquired should apply to general data science workflows and be language / platform agnostic.  

The teaching comprises of a series of weekly asyncronous lecture content, supplemented with practical lab sessions or assignments, which shall be committed to this repo. There will additionally be a final summative assignment, which shall also be completed and commited to the repository in due course.
